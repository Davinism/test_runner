# test_runner

I implemented this solution using React. Before running this solution, please run 'npm install' and then 'open index.html'.

Some limitations of this implementation and what I could improve on:

- Sorting with regards to the test status (Passed, Failed, Running)
- Styling with CSS
- Using Redux to keep code much more organized (especially with the TestList component and the TestListItem component)
